Uploaded all Python Algorithms into this repository which I have saved during Python Course.

<!-- First Algorithm -->
## Add two numbers
1. First number input.
   ```sh
   a = int(input("Enter your first Number"))
   ```
2. Second number input.
   ```sh
   b = int(input("Enter your Second Number"))
   ```
3. Define function which takes two arguments and returns result.
   ```sh
   def add_numbers(a,b):
    return a + b;
   ```
4. Print Output along with Inputs.
   ```sh
   print(str(a) + " + " + str(b) + " = " + str(add_numbers(a,b)))
   ```
